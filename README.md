Creating Fake MNIST digits with Deep Generative Models

**Summary**
- trained different generative models for generating fake images that look like the digits in the famous MNIST database
- implemented the following four models -
1. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
2. Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with Dense Layers
3. VAE with Convolutional Layers
4. Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)
- used Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy
- part of the course 'CSE 555 - Introduction to Pattern Recognition' at University at Buffalo, SUNY
